          <h1>How do home visits work?</h1>

          <p>
            The first thing to do is email us, letting us know you are interested in our services. We will then send you
            a link with the new patient paperwork to be filled out and returned. If for some reason our services are not
            the right fit for you or you are outside our treatment area, we will contact you to let you know. If
            everything is in order you will be called by one of our representatives to set up an appointment.
          </p>

          <p>
            When the doctor arrives, they will either have a second person with them or an audio recording device. This
            is done for patient and provider safety and may <span class="pHeader">NOT</span> be opted out of. You should have a space set up for the
            doctor to place a treatment table and your animals should be put away. On the first visit the doctor will
            complete a basic exam, and add more complex testing as needed. If you need more specialized testing or
            imaging, your provider will work with you to find an appropriate location and treatment will NOT be done
            that day. If the exam shows that it is safe to treat and no other testing is needed, your treatment will be
            completed on the same day as the exam.
          </p>

          <p>
            On treatment days you will be required to fill out a form specifying the area of complaint, level of pain,
            etc. Most treatments include chiropractic adjustments and light soft tissue work (muscle work). Treatments
            may also include rehab., exercise training, nutritional counseling, and more involved soft tissue treatments
            such as myofascial release or pin-and-stretch therapies.
          </p>

          <p>
            When the treatment is done the provider will complete notes for the visit and collect payment. There are NO
            cash transactions. You will be provided with digital payment options including Zell or Cash App.
          </p>

          <p>
            Your provider will then make/suggest a treatment plan or follow up visit. You may make the appointment with
            them or contact us at a later time.
            That’s the end of your appointment and it’s time for your provider to pack up and for you to enjoy not
            having to drive 30 minutes home.
          </p>

          <p>
            New patient/exam appointments have a maximum time of 45 minutes and follow up/ treatment appointments have a
            30-minute maximum.
          </p>

          <p class='pHeader'>
            MASK POLICY – All providers and staff are required to wear masks while around patients or in their home. If
            you have a cough or severe allergies, please mask up while our providers are treating you.
          </p>
